## **Project Submission**
I created a simple prototype that allows you to add, update, and delete entries in the database.

## How does my code work?
1. Add button - it will only allow you to add supplier.
2. Update button - it will only allow you to update the quantity of a product.
                   note: you need to input the product id first
3. Delete button - it will delete a supplier from the database.
                   note: you need to input the supplier id firts
